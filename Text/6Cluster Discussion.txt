-Cluster 0 has the highest average attention and mediation of the clusters, which translates to having the most focus/concentration and relaxation/calmness(according to Neurosky) while viewing the AudioVisual Materials.
-Has the lowest average brainwaves except on gamma 2 across all clusters, which translates to slower brain activity
-Cluster 0 is the oldest amongs the clusters which according to Ruth Peters, also translates to slower brain activity. (Peters, 2006)

-Cluster 5 has the highest average delta,theta,alpha1,beta1 brainwaves across all the clusters, having the fastest brain activity of the clusters
-Despite having the lowest attention of the clusters, which means having the least focus towards the audiovisual materials.

-Cluster 1 and 3 are predominantly female clusters.

-Cluster 3 has the highest average alpha2 and beta2  brain waves across the clusters(relaxed and active thinking).
-Cluster 3 is the youngest of the clusters
-Cluster 3 has the lowest gamma 2 average brainwaves which can indicate having the least familiarity with the viewed audiovisual materials (Matta and Venkitasubramanian, 2014)

-Cluster 2 is the youngest of the male clusters

-Cluster 4 has the highest average beta 2 and gamma 2 brainwaves.

-In general, brain activity was always present during the viewing of the audiovisual materials.
-Male Clusters have both the highest and lowest peaks of average attention and mediation, as well as the highest and lowest peaks of all but the average gamma 2 brainwave, pertaining to instability while
-Female Clusters have middling averages of brainwaves, which can be perceived as to having a much more consistent brainwave and constant brain activity.
-The Older clusters have the highest levels of attention and mediation, while the younger ones have unstable averages in both.
-The younger clusters have the highest averages of brain activity compared to the older ones.

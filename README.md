Objectives
	The main objective of the study intended to analyze EEG dataset along with related trivialized features that determined attention patterns from brain waves data generated through online-exhibited Audio-Visual Stimulus. 
Specifically, this study aimed to:
1.	Transform and pre-process pre-recorded EEG Dataset from a reliable datasource using Data Framing.
2.	Identify attention pattern groups using Clustering technique
3.	Develop attention pattern predictive model via Ensemble Machine Learning
4.	Test ensemble-based model using acquired EEG dataset
